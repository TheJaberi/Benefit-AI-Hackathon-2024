# Benefit AI Hackathon
## Description
This project is our attempt at creating a prototype model for the [Benefit](https://benefit.bh)'s two day AI Hackathon held on the 5th of February, 2024. Our idea is creating "your personal financial advisor, using AI & Machine Learning". Unfortunately, as first timers with AI algorithms  and Machine Learning, we couldn't finish creating our own Machine Learning prediction model. All the other work was done, however, some parts were not linked correctly due to time restrictions. In this repository, we display both our learnings/achievements, as well as our shortcomings. As of today (28/02/2024), the results and placements of the hackathon are not sent out yet, hopefully we will won by the next commit!

## Objectives
- To learn, then implement new found knowledge in Artificial Intelligence and/or Machine Learning.
- To create an innovative solution using AI through a web application prototype that predicts spending, stock market predicting and give back feedback to the user.

## AI Usages
- Using OpenAi's API as kind-of a NLP model to support our own AI-Powered Chatbot.
- Using Meta's Prophet algorithm for stock market forecasting.
- Predicting user's spending using a linear regression model.

## How we would like to proceed with this project
If we get the chance to work on this project on a larger scale, we would like to:
- To learn and Implement more accurate and advanced models, such as supervised reinforced learning, possibly random forest or others.
- To use a more comprehensive dataset with more personal features.
- To show users their potential winnings, or missed-out-on winnings on investments to motivate them financially.
- To have a chance to impact the local economy positively using our dashboard.

## Usage
```
go run main.go
